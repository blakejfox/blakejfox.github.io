# Welcome

Hello! Thank you for visiting my documentation website. This is a place where I keep things that I think are professionally interesting. The articles here are either items I learned for work or in my homelab. You can also checkout my [github](https://github.com/blakejfox), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-fox-b2a3171b2/).

## About Me 

In 2017, I graduated from Texas A&M with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Education. I have a passion for teaching and helping others, so I spent the first three years of my career teaching Algebra, Geometry, and Computer Science at Elgin High School. 

In February 2020, I decided to go a new direction with my career and become an IT professional. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work in various roles: a contractor for the Navy, supporting Credit Unions, supporting small businesses as they modernize their infrastructure and endpoint management, and most recently as a security engineer focused on M365 and Azure. 

My primary focus is keeping users data safe, and help employees be both productive and happy. I help companies leverage their existing tool sets to improve both user productivity and security posture. 

Please feel free to email me at blake@foxlabsolutions.com, or bfox@adaptivedge.com.
